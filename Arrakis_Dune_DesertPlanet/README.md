Currently, this game is 2 player local only, and not all rules are currently implemented yet.  With this becoming a passion project, it will develope slowly as time allows.  Any suggestions for implementation order or features are welcome.

Current goals are:
Network play ability for up to 6 players
A smart AI with proper region pathing

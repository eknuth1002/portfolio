# Scheduler

This is a scheduler program made for a class project that is designed to work for a consulting firm across multiple timezones.

It uses predetermined business requirements and predesigned interfaces, as well as connecting to a predesigned MySQL server.  JavaFX was designated for its interface, and Java 8 for its code version.  The ERD is included for any who wish to test this program.
